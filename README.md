# OPEN_CV_IMAGE_DETECTION_CROP
# Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to perform face detection on an image. The project utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier, a pre-trained model provided by OpenCV, to identify faces within an image. Detected faces are highlighted with green rectangles, and the individual face regions are extracted and displayed separately.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Automatically detects faces within an image using Haar Cascade Classifier.
- **Face Highlighting**: Displays the image with rectangles drawn around detected faces.
- **Face Extraction**: Extracts and displays the detected face regions separately.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
